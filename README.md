#  STEDI Human Balance Analytics

### Introduction
In this project, I am going to build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model. To be specific, I am going to use `Spark` and `AWS Glue` to extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.
